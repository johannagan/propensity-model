# Propensity Model

The purpose of this project is to predict the likelihood a visitor will make a purchase. Raw historical data is exported to BigQuery and transformed for predictive analysis. Selected features are compared for multicollinearity using a Python heat map. End result is a query where new visitor data can be transformed to be fed through the model, and visitors are rated on their likelihood to purchase. Based on the ratings, visitors can be segmented for marketing purposes.
